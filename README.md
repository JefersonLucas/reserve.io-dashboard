## About

Reserve.io is an application for equipment reservations, making it possible to **create**, **read**, **update** and **delete** reservations.

The purpose of this application is to help maintain a workflow for reservations and evolve an old personal project that had the same goal.

This new project has a very ambitious goal of trying to use modern technologies, in addition to applying techniques and evolving personally and professionally.

Throughout this documentation I will list the technologies, architectures, structure and workflows used in this project.

I am trying my best to be the most declarative in the codes kept here, if you find any syntax error or unwanted operation, forgive me.

Att.,

Jeferson Lucas
